Grid math to derive engineering outputs from geology inputs

The purpose of  reservoir_characterization_delaware_wolfcamp is to read geology grid inputs and apply correlations and equations to derive engineering outputs. The inputs are TVD, OGRi, BVHCe, and WGRp. The primary outputs are OOIP, OGIP, RfoMax, RfgMax, ROIP, and RGIP.
